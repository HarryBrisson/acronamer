been there?

never again, with acronamer!

give it some words, it'll give you an acronym


For example, if we give the acronamer API the words "simple" & "quick" & "name" & "maker", we get a variety of acronyms that are also words, such as BALM, the **B**are **A**gile **L**ist **M**anufacturer!


### API

Give the API a try with a command like that below:
